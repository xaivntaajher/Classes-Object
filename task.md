Task 1: Alarm Clock
The goal of this task is to write a single class and create a single object from it.

Write a class called AlarmClock in the main.py file.

Give this class three instance variables declared inside of an __init__ method.
A string that represents the current time
A boolean that represents whether the alarm is on or off
A string that represents the time the alarm is set to.

Write three additional methods for the class:

Method #1: Will change the current time (by giving the current time instance variable a new value) and print that new value to the console.
This method should have an additional parameter that allows a value to be passed in for the new time as a string when the method is called.

Method #2: Will toggle the alarm clock on or off by changing the boolean instance variable between true or false.

Method #3: Will set or change the current alarm time by assigning a new value to the alarm time instance variable and printing the new time to the console.
This method should have an additional parameter that allows a value to be passed in for the new time as a string when the method is called.

Once the class is complete, create a new object from your AlarmClock class and call all three of the methods from the object using dot notation.

After you have run and tested your code, create a new file in your project folder called alarm_clock.py. Move the class ONLY to this new file, and import the class from alarm_clock.py to main.py. Test your code again to verify that everything is still working!
